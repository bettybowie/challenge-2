# challenge-2

## Description

This is the UW Boot Camp Week 2 Challenge. Student was asked to create a portfolio from scratch, given some criteria. The goal is to apply and practice new knowledge acquired.

## Usage

When the page is loaded, the header contains the name on the top left corner and the navigation bar on the right. When the link on the navigation bar is clicked, the page will automatically scroll to the corresponding section. When resume is clicked, it will automatically load the resume in a new tab.

In the Work section, the first work application is larger than the rest of the applications. When the mouse is hovering over the application images, the image will become clearer. Clicking on the application image will lead to the application's deployment page. 

When the page resizes on various screens, the layout will respond accordingly to adapt to the viewport.
